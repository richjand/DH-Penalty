An empirical examination of the "Designated Hitter Penalty"

This repo contains code for my examination of the Designated Hitter penalty, the finding that baseball players perform worse when assigned to play designated hitter.

Data gathered from Baseball Reference using the code at: https://github.com/richjand/Scrape-Baseball-Reference

The R code contains a set of fixed effects models as well as an analysis using propensity score matching to correct for selection bias.
